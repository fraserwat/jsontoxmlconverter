# XML <> JSON Converter

This does what it says on the tin really. Built as a tool I doubt I'll end up using (very, very, very rarely have to work with XML) but worked nicely as a little Rust-based practice project. All the test JSON was generated quickly with ChatGPT prompts, which is a really nice use case.

## What I Learnt

- Rust's testing framework.
- Building and deploying a CLI tool.
