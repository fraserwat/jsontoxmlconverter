# XML <> JSON Converter

This does what it says on the tin really. Built as a tool I doubt I'll end up using (very, very, very rarely have to work with XML) but worked nicely as a little project to get used to Rust's weird type system, working with JSON in Rust, just a practice project. Ended up being a lot simpler than my [last learning project, a Rust-based news roundup](https://github.com/fraserwat/newsround), although I did here what I should have done then which was write tests as I went. All the [JSON test cases](https://github.com/fraserwat/jsontoxmlconverter/tree/main/src/data) were generated quickly with ChatGPT prompts, which is a really nice use case.
